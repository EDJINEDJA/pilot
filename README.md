```

## Types of Features
First of all, it is important to know the types of variables. 
The overall structre of data is 
- Numerical variable
- Categorical variable (nominal and ordinal)
Numerical variable have type int and float while the categorical have type string or object and stratified in two categories 
    - Nominal variable and 
    - Ordinal variable 
Nominal variable are the string object (eg: name of personne yes or no etc )
While Ordinal variable is a string wich have order relation 
To have highlight insight of wether the variable is categorical or numerical can help your to know wich variable we are going to transform.

```python
$ from pilot import FeaturesTypes

#Read the csv  file or something else as dataframe 
$ data= pd.read_csv(filepath_or_buffer="file.csv" , sep = ",") 
$ parser = FeaturesTypes(data)
$ parser.checkDtypes()
```

## Features selection
### check low variance
Variance is an empirical metric used to mesure dispersion of the values of a sample or of a probability distribution.
The variance is the square of the type of deviation

```python
$ from pilot import FeaturesTypes
#Read the csv  file or something else as dataframe 
$ data= pd.read_csv(filepath_or_buffer="file.csv" , sep = ",") 
$ parser = FeaturesSelection(data)
$ parser.checkLowVariance(threshold  = 0.05)
```
### Check low variance columns
It is the same process as the previous concept
It shows the name of the variables that have a low variance.

```python
$ from pilot import FeaturesTypes
#Read the csv  file or something else as dataframe 
$ data= pd.read_csv(filepath_or_buffer="file.csv" , sep = ",") 
$ parser = FeaturesSelection(data)
$ parser.checkLowVarianceColumns(threshold  = 0.05)
```

### Correlation based feature selection
Correlation based feature selection is a method used in machine learning to select the most relevant features for a given dataset. It works by analyzing the correlation between each feature and the target variable and selecting the features that have the highest correlation with the target. This can help to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, improve the performance of the model, and reduce overfitting. The most common method for correlation-based feature selection is Pearson correlation coefficient, but other methods like Mutual Information, Kendall rank correlation coefficient, and Spearman rank correlation coefficient also can be used.

strategy = "default" don't use target feature.

```python
$ from pilot import FeaturesTypes
#Read the csv  file or something else as dataframe 
$ data= pd.read_csv(filepath_or_buffer="file.csv" , sep = ",") 
$ parser = FeaturesSelection(data)
$ data = parser.CorrelationBasedFeatureSelection(treshold  = 0.95 , K=4  , strategy="default")
```

#### Correlation based feature selection (pearson correlation)
Correlation-based feature selection is a method of selecting features for a model based on the correlation between the features and the target variable. The Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of the linear correlation between two variables. In Python, this can be calculated using the pearsonr function from the scipy library.

```python
$ from pilot import FeaturesTypes
#Read the csv  file or something else as dataframe 
$ data= pd.read_csv(filepath_or_buffer="file.csv" , sep = ",") 
$ parser = FeaturesSelection(data)
$ data = parser.CorrelationBasedFeatureSelection(treshold  = 0.95 , K=4  , strategy="pearson" , target = "icd9_code")
```
####  feature selection 
Use SelectKBest wich  is a feature selection method
```python
$ from pilot import FeaturesTypes
#Read the csv  file or something else as dataframe 
$ data= pd.read_csv(filepath_or_buffer="file.csv" , sep = ",") 
$ parser = FeaturesSelection(data)
$ parser.CorrelationBasedFeatureSelection(treshold  = 0.95 , K=4  , scale="default", strategy="simple", target="icd9_code")
```

####  Correlation based feature selection (Kendall correlation)

Kendall rank correlation coefficient is a non-parametric measure of association that can be used for correlation based feature selection in Python using the Pandas library. The Kendall rank correlation coefficient, denoted by ??, is a measure of the ordinal association between two variables.
It ranges from -1 to 1, where -1 represents a perfect negative correlation, 0 represents no correlation, and 1 represents a perfect positive correlation.

```python
$ from pilot import FeaturesTypes
#Read the csv  file or something else as dataframe 
$ data= pd.read_csv(filepath_or_buffer="file.csv" , sep = ",") 
$ parser = FeaturesSelection(data)
$ parser.CorrelationBasedFeatureSelection(treshold  = 0.95 , K=4  , scale="default", strategy="kendalltau", target="icd9_code" )
```
####  Correlation based feature selection (spearmanr correlation)
The Spearman rank correlation coefficient is a measure of the correlation between two variables that is based on the ranks of the data rather than the actual values.

```python
$ from pilot import FeaturesTypes
#Read the csv  file or something else as dataframe 
$ data= pd.read_csv(filepath_or_buffer="file.csv" , sep = ",") 
$ parser = FeaturesSelection(data)
$ parser.featureSelection(self , K = 4, target  = "icd9_code", scale = "StandardScaler")
```

####  feature selection 
Use SelectKBest wich  is a feature selection method
```python
$ from pilot import FeaturesTypes
#Read the csv  file or something else as dataframe 
$ data= pd.read_csv(filepath_or_buffer="file.csv" , sep = ",") 
$ parser = FeaturesSelection(data)
$ parser.CorrelationBasedFeatureSelection(treshold  = 0.95 , K=4  , scale="default", strategy="simple", target="icd9_code")
```
####  feature selection (Recursive Feature Elimination)
Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) is a feature selection method that is implemented in the sklearn.feature_selection library in Python. It works by recursively removing the least important features from the dataset based on a specific estimator.

```python
$ from pilot import FeaturesTypes
#Read the csv  file or something else as dataframe 
$ data= pd.read_csv(filepath_or_buffer="file.csv" , sep = ",") 
$ parser = FeaturesSelection(data)
$ parser.RecursiveFeatureElimination(target = "icd9_code" , K = 5 , scale  = "default")
```

## Handle missing values
<strong> Hadling missing values </strong> is an essential in feature engineering because all data in real life comes with some missing values.
In general there is not an optimal way to handle missing values, because there is different types and charactiristics of the dataset.
Indeed, there are several ways to handle missing values in a dataset, including:

#### Deleting rows or columns with missing data:
This approach is simple and can work well if the amount of missing data is small. However, it can lead to a loss of information if a large portion of the data is removed.
To do that use strategy default

```python
$ from pilot import pilot 
#Read the csv  file or something else as dataframe 
$ data= pd.read_csv(filepath_or_buffer="file.csv" , sep = ",") 
$ pilot.HandlMissingValues(data = data, scalar = 0 , strategy = "default")
```

#### Imputing missing values:
This method involves replacing missing values with estimates, such as the mean or median of the non-missing values. This approach can help to preserve the size of the dataset, but the imputed values are not always accurate.

#### Using a predictive model:
A machine learning model can be trained to predict missing values based on the other features in the dataset. This approach can be more accurate than imputation, but it requires a sufficient amount of non-missing data to train the model.

#### Using a flag:
Creating a new column which indicates whether a value is missing or not.

#### Using interpolation technique:
replacing the missing value with the average of the value before and after the missing value.
The best approach depends on the specific situation and the amount of missing data. It's also best to use multiple techniques and compare the results.

## Handle outliers
### Z-score 

The Z-score method, also known as the standard score method, is a statistical method used to detect outliers in a dataset. It compares each data point to the mean and standard deviation of the dataset, and assigns a Z-score to each point. Z-scores are a measure of how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. A Z-score of 0 indicates that the data point is exactly on the mean, a Z-score of 1 indicates that the data point is 1 standard deviation above the mean, and a Z-score of -1 indicates that the data point is 1 standard deviation below the mean. Data points with Z-scores outside of a certain range (such as +/- 3 standard deviations) are considered outliers.
This method assumes that the data is normally distributed. If the data is not normally distributed, this method may not be appropriate.

```python
$ from pilot import pilot 
$ pilot.checkOutliersZscore(data=data)
```
### Percentille

The Percentile method is a statistical method used to identify outliers in a dataset. A percentile is a value below which a certain percent of the observations fall. For example, the 90th percentile is the value below which 90% of the observations fall. Percentiles can be used to define thresholds for identifying outliers. For example, if we consider all observations above the 95th percentile as outliers, then we can identify data points that are significantly higher than the majority of the observations in the dataset.
It is a simple and widely used method to detect outliers, especially when the data is not normally distributed. It is useful when the distribution of data is skewed, as it is not affected by the skewness.
This method can

## Features selection
## Correlation-based feature selection
This method involves calculating the correlation between each feature and the target variable, and then removing the features that have a low correlation with the target variable.

```python
$ from pilot import featuresSelection
$ parser=featuresSelection( "your data" )
$ parser.UnivariateFeatureSelection(target = 'icd9_code' , K=6)
```
### Univariate feature selection
This method uses statistical tests to select the best features based on their individual relevance to the target variable

```python
$ from pilot import featuresSelection
$ parser=featuresSelection( "your data" )
$ parser.UnivariateFeatureSelection(target = "decision" , K =6 , strategy  = "default")
```

If strategy  = "default" UnivariateFeatureSelection use as scaled methode StandardScaler

for MinMaxScaler please use  strategy  = "MinMaxScaler"

for MaxAbsScaler please use  strategy  = "MaxAbsScaler"

### Recursive feature elimination
This method uses a model to recursively remove features, building the model with the remaining features at each iteration.

```python
$ from pilot import featuresSelection
$ parser=featuresSelection( "your data" )
$ parser.RecursiveFeatureElimination(target = "decision" , K =6 , strategy  = "default")
```
If strategy  = "default" RecursiveFeatureElimination use as scaled methode StandardScaler

for MinMaxScaler please use  strategy  = "MinMaxScaler"

for MaxAbsScaler please use  strategy  = "MaxAbsScaler"
